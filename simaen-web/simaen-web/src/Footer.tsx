            <Typography variant="body2" component="p" paragraph>
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) has developed SimAEN: a free, publicly available, online tool to help state and local public health planners and decision makers explore the trade-offs between different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on COVID disease spread, and the most effective ways to align and integrate them. It aims to help public health professionals quickly answer questions about workflows, policies, and resource impacts to guide decision-making in the face of evolving circumstances.
